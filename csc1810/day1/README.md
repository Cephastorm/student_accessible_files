# Let's play

Almost every first look at a programming language starts with a simple program that prints "hello, world". It's a tradition. Here is the original from 1974 by Brian Kernighan, an author of the C programming language:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

We're not going to follow tradition.

Instead, we are going to start day 1 with something more sophisticated and just play with it.
