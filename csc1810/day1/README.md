# Let's play

Almost every first look at a programming language starts with a simple program that prints "hello, world". It's a tradition. Here is the original from 1974 by Brian Kernighan, an author of the C programming language:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

We're not going to follow tradition.

Instead, we are going to start day 1 with something more sophisticated and just play with it. 

# Our development environment

After installing our development environment, start the VirtualBox (VB) Manager. Note your windows will differ slightly from the following:

![VBManager](./img/vbmanager.png)

You will have only one Virtual Machine (VM) named ```cccsdev``` for Carthage College Computer Science Development. Notice it says it is powered off. Double click on it - a old timey looking screen will come up, just hit the return key. Wait a bit and you'll see this:

![Starting Screen](./img/starting_screen.png)

Double click on ```Visual Studio Code```. All your programming work will be done in this program.

Use the File --> Open Workspace menu command shown here:

![Open Workspace](./img/open_workspace.png)

Navigate to ```ascii```. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers don't know about letters natively - only we do. ASCII is a code for mapping numbers to letters.

Don't go into any of the ```.template``` folders. There's nothing that interesting there. Really.
