## getopt
This program is a modest tutorial on the use of getopt.


getopt is a very old C library that facilitates the parsing of command line arguments.
This tutorial (more like an example) is not complete. You can find documentation on getopt
online.

## CSC 4730 Project 1

Fork, exec, pipes and redirection


## CSC 4730 - Project 3

In this project you will take xv6 where you left off (you added a guard page) and rearrange a process' address space to conform to the more typical layout. In the image below on the left, is where you left things at the end of P2. On the right is how it will look when you are done with this project, p3.

## Userland Stride Scheduler

In this project you will build a stride scheduler in userland (i.e. in Linux, not xv6). Your scheduler will read a data file containing information like timer interrupts, job arrivals, job terminations, etc. Your output will be graded against known good results. Any deviation (even by a space) will be counted as wrong, so follow the specification completely.

## Userland Memory Management

In this project you will implement two userland memory allocation algorithms.
